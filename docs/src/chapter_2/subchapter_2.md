# Environment

## Getting Started

After setting up your project using either method, follow these steps to get your development environment running smoothly:

1. Install the required dependencies
   
   Navigate to your project directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```
   cd my-app
   ```

   ```
   npm run install
   ```

   This will download and install all the important packages specified in the `package.json` file.

2. To build your Cairo contracts:
   
   Build the contract to ensure all files are correctly compiled and prepared for development:

   ```
   npm run build-contracts
   ```

3. To start your development server, run:
   
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

   This command will start a local server and open your default web browser to display your new Starknet-Scaffold project.

Starknet-Scaffold provides other scripts to facilitate development. We will cover more of these available scripts in the coming chapters.

You now have a fully set up and running installation of Starknet-Scaffold at https://localhost:3000. For further customization and detailed instructions, please refer to the documentation.
